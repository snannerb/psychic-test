**User requests:**
build an app that tests psychic ability. have the app pick a random selection called "Image" that has 2 attributes, but keep the selection hidden. Each selection will have 2 attributes that can be chosen from all possibilities .There are 10 possible selections.  After choosing the two attributes the user selects "Next Image" button. After all 10 selections are tested a "Psychic Score" is given based on accuracy of test. Use a pixel font. At bottom of page show link <a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a> . Use only HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Project Plan
```
Here’s a **simple and clear project plan** for your app development, broken into main tasks and technical considerations:

---

### **Project Plan**
#### **1. Define the Structure (HTML)**
- **Task**: Create the HTML structure for the app.
  - Main container for the app (e.g., `<div id="app">`).
  - Section to display the current image and its attributes.
  - Input fields or buttons for user guesses.
  - "Next Image" button to progress through selections.
  - Footer to display the link: `<a href="https://pixel-oracle.com/" target="_blank">Visit Pixel Oracle</a>`.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility.
  - Embed the link as specified in the footer.

---

#### **2. Style the App (CSS)**
- **Task**: Apply pixelated theme and pixel font styling.
  - Use a pixel font for all text.
  - Design a minimalist, pixelated theme using CSS.
  - Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `@font-face` to load a pixel font (e.g., "Press Start 2P").
  - Style the app to align with the pixelated theme (e.g., solid colors, sharp edges).

---

#### **3. Implement Image and Attribute Logic (JavaScript)**
- **Task**: Handle image selection and attribute assignment.
  - Define a pool of possible attributes (e.g., colors, shapes, emotions).
  - Assign **2 random attributes** to each of the 10 images.
  - Hide the attributes until the user makes a guess.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use `Math.random()` to randomly assign attributes.
  - Store image and attribute data in an array of objects.

---

#### **4. Handle User Interaction (JavaScript)**
- **Task**: Process user guesses and manage flow.
  - Allow the user to guess attributes for each image.
  - Validate the guess and store the result.
  - Enable the "Next Image" button to move to the next selection.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use event listeners for user input and button clicks.
  - Track user guesses in an array.

---

#### **5. Calculate Psychic Score (JavaScript)**
- **Task**: Calculate and display the user’s score.
  - After all 10 selections, compare user guesses to actual attributes.
  - Calculate a score based on accuracy (e.g., percentage of correct guesses).
  - Display the score and an explanation of the scoring mechanism.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use a simple scoring formula (e.g., `(correct guesses / total guesses) * 100`).
  - Display the score in a modal or dedicated section on the page.

---

#### **6. Test and Debug**
- **Task**: Ensure the app works as expected.
  - Test the app in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  - Verify all user interactions function correctly.
  - Debug any issues with attribute assignment or scoring.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Use browser developer tools for debugging.
  - Validate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for errors.

---

### **Timeline**
1. **Day 1**: Define HTML structure and basic CSS styling.
2. **Day 2**: Implement image and attribute logic in JavaScript.
3. **Day 3**: Handle user interaction and scoring logic.
4. **Day 4**: Test and debug the app.
5. **Day 5**: Final review and deployment.
